We've been getting reports of players infected by a strange new disease. Days after infection we've seen strange, aggressive behaviors from them. After further inspection we found it is a parasite. Now named Immortuos Calyx, it poses a high threat to our way of life. We have developed a cure... but it's imperfect, and we can not risk distribution at this time. Stay safe, cook your food, and avoid infected individuals at all costs.

Immortuos Calyx is a parasite loosely based off of the Velonaceps Calyx parasite from Barotrauma.

Immortuos Calyx slowly infects the player over time, ingraining itself in the host's organs, and providing all sorts of trouble (and in certain conditions, benefits!)
